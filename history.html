			<h3>Early Music</h3>
			<dd>
				Since the Medieval ages, music was controlled by religeous groups, and it started to spread slowly during the reniance period until that shady phase of music ended during the 1600s.
				Dies Irae is one of the most notable works during the Medieval ages.</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt>
			<h3>Baroque</h3>
			<dd>
				During the baroque period, music theory was outstandingly spreading and advancing by innovators like Bach, and the music notation we use today was standarized then.</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt><h3>Classical</h3>
			<dd>
				In the Classical period, music was at its highest peak, and new composers were trying to orchestrate many instruments to play one peice. During then, concerti, opera, quartets, and much more were developed to their finest by masters of music like Mozart.</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt><h3>Romantic</h3>
			<dd>
				During the Romantic period, composers' main aim was to change the way music was used, mostly as a way to celebrate royal and to perform religeous events, to another way, that of self-expression, started by the deaf composer Beethoven's carrer's nature as a freelancer, which allowed him to express himself more freely than preceeding composers.</dd>
		</dt>
		<dt><h3>Modern</h3>
			<dd>
				In the modern era, it became basic to have vocals in the peices, transforming peices to songs, and most importantly, music, from a way to express one's self, to a vocal accompaniment and a harmonic device, leaving self-expression to the lyrics. That's why all modern music sound alike and aren't as expressive as during earlier periods.</dd>
