				view and edit sound waves and analyze frequencies and provides you with
				much more sound engineering tools, and since it's lightweight and
				user-friendly, it is the best sound engineering software available.

				producer, LMMS runs on all known operating systems, and is lightweight
				and has an easy to learn GUI with lots of pro features that makes the
