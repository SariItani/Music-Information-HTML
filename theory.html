		<h2>Theory</h2>
		<p>
			Music Theory is the study of the principles of music, how music works. It
			is a broad topic with hundreds of thousands of books written about it, so
			it would be mundane to explain it breifly. Hence, below, some of the main
			concepts or music theory are introduced.

                        <h3>Rhythm</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Rhythm is the amount of beats meant to be played in a certain amount of time. Not to be confused with the Tempo, which is the option in music composition which defines how many whole-note beats there are in a minute.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Pitch</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Pitch is the measure of how high or low (in frequency) a note must be played. Not to be confused with Timbre, which is the quality of the sound, which also provides information about how soft or rough a sound is.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Melody</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Melody is the use of pitch and rhythm to generate a meaningful and expressive collection of sequential notes.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Harmony</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Harmony is the use of multiple pitches played at once to generate more expressive and meaningful sounds.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Counterpoint</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Counterpoint is the use of more than one melody using the knowledge of Harmony to generate even more expressive and meaningful passages of music.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Compositional Formats</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Sonatas, fugues, and canons are examples of formats available for composers to base their peices upon. Just like poems have specific formats poets must abide by, composers also have certain guidlines and formats for composing music.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Orchestration</h3>
                        <dd>
                              Orchestration is mainly concerned with what instruments to be used to play a certain musical passage, and what registers are suitable for each Instrument.</dd>
                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                        <h3>Circle of FIfths</h3>
                        <dd>
                              The circle of fifths is a very useful tool that saves composers many calculation steps and a lot of time figuring out what works out in their compositions in general. It is an arrangement of ascending notes by intervals of perfect fifths, but it's visualised as a circle.</dd>

            <p>And the list goes on...</p>
